## React
#
- React is a JavaScript library for creating user interfaces. It has a declarative vocabulary that allows developers to construct reusable UI components and rapidly update them as the underlying data changes. React is in charge of the fundamental features of React applications, such as managing component lifecycles, handling state and props, and rendering components to the virtual DOM.

## ReactDom
#
- ReactDOM is a React rendering implementation developed specifically for browser applications. It offers the functions required to render React components to the browser's DOM (Document Object Model). ReactDOM connects React's virtual DOM representation to the actual DOM, enabling React components to be rendered in the browser.
